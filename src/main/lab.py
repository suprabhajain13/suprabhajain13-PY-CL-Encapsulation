class BankAccount:
    """
    A class representing a bank account with basic operations.
    
    Encapsulation:
    Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on bundling
    the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.
    It enables the data to be hidden from the outside world and can only be accessed through the defined interface
    provided by the class. In this BankAccount class, the account number and balance are encapsulated as private
    attributes (_account_number and _balance), which can only be accessed and modified through the defined
    methods (deposit, withdraw, get_balance, get_account_number).
